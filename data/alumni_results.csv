William Wong,2005,,,,,,[],,,,,,"A comprehensive search for William Wong, an alumnus who completed a radiology residency or fellowship at Yale with a year of entry in 2005, did not yield a definitive match with publicly available information. The Yale Alumni Association lists a ""William Wong '09"", whose graduation year could align with a 2005 start for a residency or fellowship, but his medical field is not specified. Yale School of Medicine bulletins for 2004-2006 also do not list a William Wong as a resident or fellow in the Department of Diagnostic Radiology. Other individuals named William Wong found in searches, such as a radiation oncologist at Mayo Clinic Arizona (graduated 1993) or a Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine (General Internal Medicine) at Northwestern Medicine (MD 1996), do not match the specified Yale radiology criteria from 2005. Therefore, specific professional details for the requested alumnus could not be definitively identified.",15934,5180,1863,1094,2914
